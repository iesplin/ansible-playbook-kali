# Kalifigurator 2.0  dafasf

[![CI](https://github.com/iesplin/ansible-playbook-kali/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/iesplin/ansible-playbook-kali/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

These playbooks install most of the tools that I require with some tweaks for hardening, personalization, and making Kali quieter.

How to use
------

- Install Kali using the default install. See https://github.com/iesplin/kali-preseed for an example

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iesplin/ansible-playbook-kali
    ```

    ```bash

    ./deploy.sh
    ```
