# Ansible 4 Kali
>  Manually configuring Kali? Ain't nobody got time for that.

These playbooks install most of the tools that I require with some tweaks for hardening, personalization, and making Kali quieter.

Steps:
1. Deploy a minimal Kali install. See https://github.com/iesplin/kali-minimal for an example
2. Clone this repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iesplin/ansible-playbook-kali
```
3. Run the deploy script
```bash
cd ansible-playbook-kali
./deploy.sh
```
